INT. APARTMENT
(Ted opening wedding invitation, Ted sits down and looks at R.S.V.P card, makes check mark)
Future Ted VO: When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.
('Two Months and 26 Days Later,' Ted sitting on couch talking on phone)
Ted: Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?
(screen splits, Barney in cab on phone on left side of screen, Ted on right side)
Barney: Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.
Barney: You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.
Ted: Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?
Barney: Ted, it's a simile.
Ted: Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?
Future Ted VO: Of course I knew who I wanted to bring: Robin.
(TV screen showing Robin reporting in front of bridge)
Future Ted VO: The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.
(shot of Derek and Robin sitting in back of car)
Future Ted VO: Pft, Derek.

4. STELLA'S POV 足 CARRIE WHITE

  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-
  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a
  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella
  through the hedge.

                                STELLA
                         Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
                                (turning down the radio)
                         How long have you been there?

                               CARRIE
                               (not smiling; pointing with her finger)
                         What are those?

  Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing
  her breasts 足 white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit 足 not out of any particular
  modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.

                                STELLA
                         Those are my breasts, honey.

                                 CARRIE
                                 (a beat; then solemnly)
                         I wish I had some.

                                STELLA
                         You will. `Course you'll have to wait a
                         couple of years, but 足

Both are semi-structured transcripts which need to be further processed.
