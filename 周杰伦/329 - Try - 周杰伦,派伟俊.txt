Try
(《功夫熊猫3》电影全球主题曲)
中文词：方文山
英文词：冼佩瑾
曲：派伟俊
演唱：派伟俊/周杰伦
小派：You always have to do something
Just to show the world that you exist
So you try

You hope they'll see

If on this brand new day you'll look
On the bright side of the same old street
You will see

What you deserve
Jay：Let's go
我说几华里我送别了过去
他们说人生的结局非常的戏剧
塞外羌笛孤城马蹄
在武侠的世界里谁与谁来为敌
合：La la la la la la la la la
黄沙里用竹笔写下的字叫勇气
Jay：You just have to try

To be who you are
And you ought to fly

Step into the light
小派：And soon you will find
Be yourself
Somewhere deep inside

There's a universe right there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself
Jay：Oh Try try try try
Just do what is right
You'll fly so high

Let go of the brakes
Be who you are
Be yourself 'cause your power is on
合： When you believe in what you've got
You know you're perfect just be who you are

小派：So they don't see what you're made of
But I like you and I know they're wrong
Now it's time

To show them what you got

Let the blue skies cheer you on
Embrace the wind we'll ride along
You're perfect when you're who you are
Jay：这世界有些事有些人凭感觉
别管他旌旗密布遍野狼烟霜雪
那故事在穿越而我也在翻页
一行行做好准备敏锐而直接
合：La la la la la la la la la
爱不灭真实的一切废话全收回
小派：You just have to try

To be who you are
Jay：And you ought to fly

Step into the light
小派：And soon you will find

Be yourself

Somewhere deep inside
There's a universe right there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself
Jay：Oh Try try try try
Just do what is right
You'll fly so high

Let go of the brakes
合： Be who you are
Be yourself 'cause your power is on
When you believe in what you've got
You know you're perfect just be who you are

小派：You just have to try

To be who you are
Jay：And you ought to fly

Step into the light
小派：And soon you will find
Be yourself

Somewhere deep inside

There's a universe right there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself
Jay：Oh Try try try try
Just do what is right

You'll fly so high

Let go of the brakes
合： Be who you are
Be yourself 'cause your power is on
When you believe in what you've got
You know you're perfect just be who you are
