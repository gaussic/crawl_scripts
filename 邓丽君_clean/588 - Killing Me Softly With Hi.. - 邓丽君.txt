Killing me softly with his song
演唱：邓丽君

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song.

I heard he sang a good song,
I heard he had a style,
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy,
a stranger to my eyes
strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever,
Embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish,
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song.

He sang as if he knew me ,
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me ,
AS if l wasn't there
and  he just keep singing 
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his word
Killing me softly with his song

Strumming my pain 
Singing my life

lalala....
Telling my whole life with his word
Killing me softly with his song
