Serpentskirt(Cocteau Twins featuring Faye Wong asian version)
蛇皮裙（极地双子星＆王菲）

菲：只有有地山有洞
谁都沙沙贝搭
有你有我也有空
呀吗搭搭贝搭
哈地贝地打
哈地巴滴答
你哈你百地
呀一地
一恰大
哈地巴滴答
哈地答滴答

CT：Telling me words in Turkish
Your nosiness, your belly
Frantically or mimicly
Your nosiness, your belly

菲：哈地贝地打
哈地巴滴答
你哈你百地
呀一地
咿呀一呀啊搭
哈地巴滴答
哈地答滴答

CT：Has your mother gone
as a baby as a baby
Has a playmate
We are helpless as babies
As a baby
Has your mother gone
Reach out your hand
He seldom will
And a memory
Go out
He seldom will
Has your mother gone
Reach out your hand
He seldom will
And a memory
Go out
He seldom will

菲：哈答贝地不有空
美答答答都烧
没谁我也都有空
滴答答打背打

CT：Some forget where to go
They know fear again
