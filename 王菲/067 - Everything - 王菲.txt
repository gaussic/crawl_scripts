Everything
演唱：王菲

哦

孤单纵使好友千万
陪我喝酒
空间纵使欢笑亿万
亦觉挤满了忧
光阴怎不将一切也沖淡
諠哗声怎么仿似
遮不去我的低叹
怎么每到热闹时仍甚冷
OH
可能当失去你
至觉当天最美
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING
可能当失去你
至确当天最美
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING
傻得很
那天拥有之后
随意放手
盲得很
我怎么怎么不珍惜
便把你送走
多么的想跟你再一次
可不可开恩一次
准许我试多一次
即使这已是极迟
仍愿试
OH
可能当失去你
至觉当天最美
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING
可能当失去你
方发现爱已死
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING

OH
多么的想跟你再一次
可不可开恩一次
准许我试多一次
即使这已是极迟
仍愿试
OH
可能当失去你
至觉当天最美
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING
可能当失去你
方发现爱已死
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING

YOU WERE MY LIFE
YOU WERE MY LOVE

哦
YOU WERE MY LIFE
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING

YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING

YOU WERE MY LIFE
