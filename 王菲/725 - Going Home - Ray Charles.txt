陈曦 - Going Home (OT:乘客-王菲)

Not very often have we met
But the musics been too bad
Can only sense happiness
if the music is sad

So, Im going home
I must hurry home
Where a life goes on

Were too old to make a mess
Dreams will keep me young
Old enough to stress
Only mirrors tell the time

So, Im going home
I must hurry home
So will my life go on

Yes, Im going home
Going home alone
And your life goes on
