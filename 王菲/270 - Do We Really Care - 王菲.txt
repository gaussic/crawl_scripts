Do We Really Care?
演唱：王菲

I saw a picture of a small girl
Crying and living in a lost world
The men fight for dear God
She don't care
cause there ain't nothing left to share
I'd watched T.V. about a sick girl
She was only nine but she'll be gone soon
When and where she's going God will know
She doesn't want the sun to go
Don't you know that we care
Keep the faith and hope is here
Deep in my heart I ask myself
Do we really really care
I read  the paper of a coloured boy
He was starving so we're the lone vultures
Why so full of sorrow no tomorrow
There's no rainbow
Will he ever know?
Don't you know that we care
Keep the faith and hope is here
Deep in my heart I ask myself
Do we really really care
Don't you know that we pray
For you to see the light of day
For you to bring back the look of love
Words of wisdom
Is it enough
