Dreams
词曲：Stevie Nicks
江美琪《我爱王菲》
now here go again you say
you want your freedom
well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that youshould
play the way you feel it
but listen carefully to the sound
of your loneliness
like a heartbeat
dirves you mad
in the stillness of
remembereing what you had
and what you lost
and what you had
and what you lost
thunder only happens when it's rainning
players only love you when they're playing
say
women
they will come and they will go
when the rain washes you clean
you konw
you'll know
now here i go again i see
the crystal visions
i keep my visions to myself
it's only me who wants to wrap
around your dreams and
have you any dreams you like to sell
dreams of loneliness
like a heartbeats
drives you mad
in the stillness of remembering
what you had
and what you lost
and what you had
and what you lost
oh
you'll know
