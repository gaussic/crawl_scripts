the power of love
演唱：邓丽君

The whispers in the morning
of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
as I look in your eyes.
I hold on to your body
and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
Cause I am your lady
And you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can.
Lost is how I'm feeling
lying in your arms.
When the world outside's too much to take.
That all ends when I'm with you.
Even though there may be times
it seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by said
Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but
I'm ready to learn
of the power of love
The sound of your heart beating.
Made it clear suddenly.
The feeling that I can't go on
is light years away
Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but
I'm ready to learn
of the power of love
Woo the power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened but
I'm ready to learn
of the power of love
