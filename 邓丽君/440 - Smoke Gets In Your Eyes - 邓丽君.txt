Smoke Gets In Your Eyes
邓丽君

They asked me how I knew my true love was true.
Oh,
I of course replied
"something here inside cannot be denied."
They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind."
Oh,When your heart's on fire,
you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them
and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love.
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love.
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide. Oh,
So I smile and say
"when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes!"
smoke gets in your eyes

(smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes)
