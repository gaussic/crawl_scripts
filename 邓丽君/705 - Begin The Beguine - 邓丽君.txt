Begin The Beguine


演唱：邓丽君

When they begin the beguine

It brings back the sound

Of music so tender

It brings back a night
Of tropical splendor

It brings back a memory

Ever green

I'm with you once more

Under the stars

And down by the shore

An orchestra's playing

And even the palms seem
To be swaying

When they begin the beguine

So don't let them begin the beguine 

Let the love that was once a fire
Remain an ember

Let it sleep like the dead desire

I only remember

When they begin the beguine

Oh yes  let them begin the beguine 
Make them play

Till the stars that were there
Before return above you

Till you whisper to me once more 
Darling  I love you

When they begin the beguine

So don't let them begin the beguine 

Let the love that was once
A fire remain an ember

Let it sleep like the dead desire
I only remember

When they begin the beguine

Oh yes  let them begin the beguine 
Make them play

Till the stars that were there
Before return above you

Till you whisper to me once more 
Darling  I love you

When they begin the beguine

When they begin the beguine
