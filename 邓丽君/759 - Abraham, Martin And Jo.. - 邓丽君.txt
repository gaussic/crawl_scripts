Abraham,Martin And John

 邓丽君 演唱   佚名 词曲

 Has anybody here seen my friend Abraham?
 Can you tell me where he's gone?

 He freed a lot of people,
 But it seems the good die young,
 I just looked around and he's gone.

 But I just looked around and he's gone.

 But I just looked around and he's gone.

 Has anybody here seen my friend John?
 Can you tell me where he's gone?

 He freed a lot of people,
 But it seems the good die young,
 I just looked around and he's gone.

 Has anybody here seen my friend Martin?
 Can you tell me where he's gone?

 He freed a lot of people,
 But it seems the good die young,
 I just looked around and he's gone.
