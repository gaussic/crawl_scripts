My Way (现场演绎)
演唱：邓丽君

And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friends I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I travelled each and every high-way
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
May I say "not in a shy way"
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a woman what has she go
It not herself then she has not
To say the things she truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
