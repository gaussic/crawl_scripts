(Gudda Gudda)
They call me Young Gudda,
I'm all about the doe still,
And anybody in my way, Roadkill,
Evrything my hands touch turn to gold,
Money, Knots and Jewels with no records sold, (Yeah)
I'm Manhandling rappers with no effort,
So imagine what'll happen when I start applying pressure,
Guillotine flow who ready to get severed,
In or out the booth you could get leveled nigga

(Jae Millz)
Yo, We are Young Money,
Nigga you can't troch us,
It's bout to get real ugly, Amarosa,
YM vultures, they ain't a family doper,
We done changed the way the game look, Sammy Sosa, (Ha Ha)
This is like it ain't a Job, the Audomare and Shapor,
Just symoblise I go hard,
Navy on Navy camero I did all for the yankees,
Did it all for New York and this Love no need to thank me

(Tyga)

Young Money muthafucka till the world end,
Money over weight, Bits, Rosanne,

Skinny nigga dubbed up, Low hand,
Lindsey the white benz, same colour mike skin,
Make ya soul spin when the ping loading,
Au revoir, goodbye, now applaud

(Lil Chuckee)
Young money lil G,
Battle juice in my blood,
Jumpin out the ? man,
You better have ya bungee cord,
Since Wayne took me off the leash,
I ain't lose a fight yet,
Now come drag ya dog out the ring how he love that,
Yung wid a attitude, watch how ya talk to me,
Keep playin freddy boi, I'll leak on ya elm street,
Trouble is what you want dog, pain is what you don't get,
It's Young money till the bone grissle

(Lil Twist)
Young money good night,
And yeah Im gonna shine like an Ultra Violet light,
Lil twist cold cellar like its open tonight,
31'st nigga to write, You need a telescope sight,
To try to see me, I'm so far gone,
Even though I'm goin out kids, I'm so far on
I gotta house full of cheques like playboy home,
Wrapping up my lifestyle and I smashed this song
Twizzi

(Nicki Minaj)
I'm in that cotton pink bent,
Put mass on the guts,
Kunta kento on the clutch,
You at the bottom of the pole, Totem,
Like Lamar odom, I ball, scrotom,
Flyer than a cricket so they call me Nicki Jimany,
And Its going down like santa in the chimney,
You don't ball break ya baby back ribs,
You need more assist than the handicap kids

(Shanell)
Young money we rockstars,
So fuck wit ya magnum on,
And hold on we go long,

We in that, we run that, we respect,
We hit em when we see em coming back for more,
Back for more..

(Mack Maine)
Michael wade family in the building you can't hold us,
Me, taz & wayne we the 3 new moguls,
Buffet around here ya'll boys scrape the plates,
And we dont eat up in our ? cuz we got paper plates,
Soon as we leave the club damn let the models go,
One word I forgot to say on his album, Hollygrove!,
This track different now they nod this the genesis,
Young money murderers, We killin shit

(Drake)
Alright I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nuthin you would think im playin tetris,
Thousand dollar sweater on but I never sweat shit,
Swear the beats they give me got a muthafuckin death wish,
Yeah, tell me who controls kings, I don't follow rules, stupid old things,
Flying through the city in a coupe with those wings,
My team deserves some muthafuckin supabowl rings, Young Money

(Lil Wayne)
I'm so in this bitch, CEO in this bitch,
Lil Weezy stand tall, Tippytoe in this bitch
Blood gang muthafucka da da doe in this bitch,

In the body of the world, money is the blood,
And everyday I be back and foward to the blood bank,
Uhh making deposits till I fucking faint,
New orleans, nigga how about no fuking saints,

Matter fact its too tight add a couple links,
