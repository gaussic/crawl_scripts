Muffin Man（英）
词：Adrian Fu  曲：Adrian Fu
Paging all my people who are hurt
In the desert of their lies
We won't take this from them anymore
We're not astray
We're not ashamed
Come on down my friend from here
There's a chance, I know, of rain
Wash those tears you have inside
It's a fear, it will subside
You should try, you should try
Change it any way you can
Rhyme it like the Muffin Man
You should try, you should try
You don't need to hide it anymore
It's OK, you can feel
I don't have to tell you who you are
You're a star, you're a star
Come on down my friend, I know
This is life, and we've got to go
Wash those tears you have inside
It's a fear, it will subside
You should try, you should try
Change it any way you can
Rhyme it like the Muffin Man
You should try, you should try
Wash those tears you have inside
It's a fear, it will subside
You should try, you should try
Change it any way you can
Rhyme it like the Muffin Man
You should try, you should try
Every time I see your face
You look at me with foolish eyes
Everybody hold your horses
Don't believe in what they say
Everyone is here tonight
So you should try

那些让你死去活来的女孩
词：黄伟文  曲：Adrian Fu
看你气冲冲的走进来
对着吧台 发着呆
我就知道你的心情坏
不用猜  为了女孩
这夜幸好有我在
教你早一点看开
那些让你徘徊在
水深火热的恋爱
You Should Try
You Should Try
那些让你浮沉在
死去活来的女孩
You Should Try
You Should Try
你会有段时间难释怀
我明白  我明白
可是这是套餐分不开
虽悲哀  也精彩
下面这句话厉害
请你好好记下来
那些让你徘徊在
水深火热的恋爱
You Should Try
You Should Try
那些让你浮沉在
死去活来的女孩
You Should Try
You Should Try
如果一点点失败
让你未来更可爱
You Should Try
You Should Try
多少恋爱的天才
也是这样练出来
You Should Try
You Should Try
没有经历错的爱
情歌怎样写出来
没有碰过些狠女孩
心酸怎样唱出来
不想生命太空白
You Should Try
