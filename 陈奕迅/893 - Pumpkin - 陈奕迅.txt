we should now not be together
if you want another

let us be apart forever
be the way you are

if you're wondering if you should
send a card don't bother

but i'll still be thinking of
you everytime i write
hold me in your arms and love forever now
take me away and let the whole world vanish
till there's only two of us here
then you cherish all the love that we have now
how can you ever let someone coming
between the two of us and
let her make us break apart
