What A Wonderful World
演唱:陈奕迅

I see trees of green
red roses too
I see 'em bloom
for me and you
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
clouds of white
Bright blessed days
dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world
The colors of a rainbow
so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
sayin' how do you do
They're really sayin' I love you
I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
than I'll never know
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world
