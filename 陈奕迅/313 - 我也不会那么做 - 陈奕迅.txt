曲:陈奕迅 词:陈奂仁

this is the story
story of love
story of abuse
story of apologies.....too late
口口声声听到你说
你会为了他离开我
跟他挂了电话看都不看我
默默无言的走过
if i only never heard you say it to him
也许我也不会难过
if i only could believe that you were lying to him
我的拳头
我也不会那么做
也许不会 hit you
那么做
不是不要向你道歉
只是害怕失去尊严
当我感觉到那冰冷的手铐
一百个sorry(s)也听不见
i'm a poet
i shoot of lyices like a rocket
i knew i heard you say it
i thought that i could talk it
but face it
no matter how i play it
no matter how i take it
forget it it's a one way ticket to the cell
it's a just as well ain't muc to tell
you were cheating on me
and you pretendin' everything is well
yeah i could chill
then what's the deal
so what's a man gotta do
just to get some repect from you
